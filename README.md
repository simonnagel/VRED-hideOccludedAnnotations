# VRED-hideOccludedAnnotations
##Hides Annotations that are occluded by other other Geometries
Use the script to hide annations that are occluded by other geometries.

By default you always see annotations on top of your rendering. This script will hide annotations, if its position point cannot be seen by the camera.


Just paste the Scene in the Script Editor of VRED and press run.
Navigate around and you will notice that the annotations behind objects will be hidden.
Feel free to adjust annotation properties in the Annotation Module.
